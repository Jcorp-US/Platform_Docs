# The Quiz Builder

When you go to create a quiz, you are given a blank canvas, a powerful tool; really, a thing of beauty: *the Quiz Builder*. Let's dive in...

First up, name your quiz. Don't leave "*Quiz Name*". Instead, pick a descriptive, helpful name. (Technically, you can have two quizzes of the same name; but ***don't***).

Then, enter __Pretext__: *text that comes before* the quiz. Maybe pre-reading materials, directions, or well-wishes. If it is a reading test, putting the passage here may help (if students are allowed the passage during the quiz, that is). It is entirely up to you. If you cannot imagine anything helpful to put in this free spot, then you are welcome to leave it blank. Note: this is plain-text. No formatting is supported.

Now, you are prompted to select a type for your first question. After the last question (once you make at least one), you will also see a similar prompt querying the type for the next question (if you want to create one). We recommend a maximum of 100 questions per quiz, for technical stability, as the quiz-taking system gets a little slow after this amount (though your students may revolt if you exceed 75).

### Question Types

1. **Multiple Choice**: A plain text question and up to 4 answer choices (A, B, C, and D). Select the correct answer by clicking the circle to the left of the correct letter choice. 

2. **Vocabulary**: Type in the vocabulary word. If you want, click *Generate Definition*. This will cause us to query our in-house dictionary and fill in the definition for you. If you prefer not to, then type in the definition of your choice.
	* Our dictionary is from 1912, so some words may not be present &mdash; and others will be inappropriate or offensive, we are working on correcting those; if you find one, [report it immediately](https://platformlms.org/contact).

3. **Fill in the Blank**: Type in the statement. Use brackets (**[** and **]**) to encase blanks. For example, if you type *The [quick] brown fox [jumped] over the lazy dog*, we will leave a spot where *quick* and *jumped* belong and, when grading, check for those answers. You may have an unlimited number of blanks, though you may only have one correct answer per blank. The correct answer is case insensitive. A preview is displayed below the field, for your convenience, with underlines symbolizing words to be replaced with blanks.

4. **Written Response**: _This question type (is the only one that) will not be computer graded._ You type a question, and your students will get a reasonably large text-box to answer in. There is no limit on the length of their answer. You will see the answer and mark it correct or incorrect from the [score viewer](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/04-quizzes/03-score_info.md).

### DOCX Importer 

If you click the *Or Import as a Word Document* link (on the top right of the quiz builder), you will be taken to the DOCX importer, which you can use to convert a Word document into a Platform quiz.

Steps:
1. Drop a **.docx** file on the upload page. Maximum size is 500KB (aka 512,000B or ~0.5MB). 

2. Change the quiz name (don't miss this).

3. Follow the well-written, descriptive directions on the right side of the screen. 
	* When you create a question (or add pretext), you will be asked to <mark>highlight</mark> the pertaining section of the word document (so, high-tech copy-paste).

The quiz builder is simple, yet powerful. It is fully supported on all browsers that Platform supports. It has only partial support on mobile.
