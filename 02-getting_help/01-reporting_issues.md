Reporting Issues
=============

No software is perfect. It's a fact. Even if there are no *known* issues, or no issues *publicly revealed*, there *will* be bugs. That being said, if you encounter an issue that you believe is a bug, we have a very open and transparent way of allowing you to check if we know about it and, if not, report it. (Directions follow)

First, though, let's discuss the definition of a bug. A bug is __not__ a feature that you want, but we don't offer. A bug is a already existing feature acts in a way that it is not expected to. An error message is a pretty good hint that there was a bug. If something won't save, it is probably a bug. If it looks wrong, it might be a bug. In the end, it is up to you to decide if you think it's a bug. *If in doubt, submit it anyway.*

Directions to file a bug report:
 1. Go-to the [Platform Bug Tracker](https://platformlms.org/support/bugs/) (best to right-click and open that link in a new tab)
 2. Scroll through the list of reported bugs and see if you notice the one you were planning on reporting.
	 - If you do, click on it. You can then read our status in resolving it.
 3. If you don't see it, scroll back to the top of the page. 
 4. Hit the red button labeled, "Submit Bug"
 5. Submit your report.
	- You will get a email confirming the bug, when we read your report.
