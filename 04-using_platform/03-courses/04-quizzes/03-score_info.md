# Quiz Score Information

When a student submits a [quiz](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/04-quizzes/02-information.md), it is automatically graded. However, some question types (particularly written response questions) cannot be automatically graded. For those questions, you will need to grade them manually. Further, our systems are not perfect, and you may want to accept some close answers that we rejected. To do this (or just to see what a student got wrong), you will need to see the student's score report.

A students score report, called the *Quiz Score Details* page, includes the following sections:
* **The student's name (written in cursive).** This carries the most importance when you are binge-grading.
* **The quiz score and math.** On the top-right corner, the percentage score is displayed. Use the pencil button to manually override the score (if, for example, a student cheated). The "math" below shows the number of questions the student got wrong and right, adding up to the total number of questions graded.
* **The question-level report.** Finally, there is a table containing a list of questions that the student got incorrect, or that could not be graded.
	* For incorrect answers, this table presents both the student's answer and the correct answer, and provides you the option of overriding the mark (making the answer correct). This action is irreversible.
	* For ungraded questions, you are presented with the students answer, and given the option of marking the answer either correct or incorrect. This action is easily reversible.
* **The 'Next Student' button.** This button allows you to easily move on to the next student submission (ordered chronologically), providing for easy binge-grading.

In the end, quiz score reports are an powerful, versatile way to keep you in control of your students grades, allowing you to override, second-guess, or alter our automatic grading. Along with assignments, all of the grades produced here will go to the [gradebook](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/05-gradebook.md).
