# Assignment Submissions

When you create an assignment, by definition, you want something done; and, likely, you want something back. Submissions are how you get something back.

When you [set up](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/03-assignments/01-about_assignments.md) an assignment, you select a submission type. We'll get to those &mdash; but first, a note: the type of submission a given assignment accepts _can not_ be changed after you first set it.

Okay, now let's dive into submission types:
## Submission Types

1.  **Link**: The student will submit a *URL* to a webpage. You, as the teacher, will also get a link, with the option to open it embedded (inside of Platform; some websites, for security reasons, forbid this) or in a new tab. Link __must__ be in format _http(s)://example.com/_.

2. **Text**: The student will copy text or type directly into Platform. No images or formatting is allowed. You will be able to see it displayed within the submission grader.

3. **File Upload**: The student will upload a file for you to grade. The maximum file size currently stands at 500kb. Files of type pdf, docx (but *not* doc), and mp4 will be displayed within the submission grader. All other file types will prompt you to download.
	* Note: docx file will have formatting, but will _not_ show images. You can download the original upload to see images and special formatting.

Now, let's discuss the submission grader.
## The Submission Grader

This is the submission grader. The student's submission is displayed on the left-hand side of the screen. After reading or analyzing the student's submission, you may enter a grade (percent) for the submission, and add commentary, on the right-hand portion of the screen. (Note: comments are optional but strongly recommended.) Hit the *Grade* button on the bottom, and you're done (don't forget this part).

To move onto the next submission (if you are binge-grading, for example), click *Grade Next Submission* on the top portion of the screen. 

That's it. Really.
