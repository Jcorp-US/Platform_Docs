# Creating an Account, As Part of a District

You don't need to! Your district will create your account, on your behalf. You should login using your district's login page, which will look like this: [app.platformlms.org/d/mydistrict](https://app.platformlms.org/d/TISD). If you don't know your district's page, you should contact them. (That being said, if you happen to reach out to us, we'll give you a disappointed stare, and then tell you what your district's page is.)
