# What is Platform?

Platform is a Learning Management System (LMS) that empowers teachers to instruct and inspire, and helps students to connect and learn, while effortlessly staying out of the way.

Here's some [marketing copy](/why) about what Platform can do for you: 

## For Teachers
Platform offers a powerful new kind of learning system. One designed with teachers and students in mind, and with teacher/student interactions in mind. Because of this, Platform offers astounding flexibility, enabling you to teach however you want to. This flexibility, though, is behind the scenes. Platform's interface remains distinctly simple and intuitive. When you do need the complex features Platform offers, they are precisely where you expect them to be. Platform streamlines teacher workflows, making your job easier, so you can focus on what you love: teaching. And Platform will be there, providing a wealth of features, while staying out of your way. 

## For Students
Platform is here for you, too. Platform keeps all of your courses in one place. And, since Platform is easy-to-use, you won't need any adjusting (from the last 10 LMSs your school used, that is). Platform is agile and adaptable, available on every device. On your phone? Yep. It feels just like a native app (and, if you save it to your home screen, it will really feel native). Your tablet? Of course. Your laptop or school computer? Yes! Wherever, however, and whenever, Platform is there for you. (Side note: submitting homework at 2 AM is still not recommended.) If you need a Platform account (for one or more teacher(s) that are using Platform independently, and not through your school or district), you can [signup](/signup?t=s), right now. If your school or district is already on Platform, you should [go to their login page](#/03-getting_started/02-logging_in/02-as_part_of_a_district.md). If you don't know it, you should ask your teacher (or you could try logging in [here](https://app.platformlms.org)).
