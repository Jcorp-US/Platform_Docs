# My Account

Your account is, of course, important. You can manage information about your account on the "Account" page (look in the [sidebar](#/04-using_platform/01-dashboard.md)).

## About Your Account
The main account page includes information about you:
* Your Profile Image: Currently just a generic person, but we may allow this to be changed in the future.
* Your Name: Please [notify us](/contact) if this is wrong.
* Your Email Address: We may send account notifications, along with some other information, to this email. Yes, our terms reserve us the right to send marketing communication here. This may have been provided by your district. If this email is wrong, [notify us](/contact).
	* Note: Not all users have an email on file. If you don't, that's fine. You are only required to notify us (as per [our terms](/terms)) if it's wrong, not if it's missing.
* Your Title: Either *Teacher* or *Student*. This is immutable (meaning it cannot be changed). 
	* Like the picture above? It's just a joke; *Important Person* is not a title, and it's impossible for anyone to ever get that.
* Your Username: If you don't have a username (because you log in through a district), this will be empty. That's fine.
	* Note: If you login using Platform, through a district, your district identifier appears before your username. Fun fact: you *can* log in from the [main login page](https://app.platformlms.org) using that username (including the identifier) and your normal password, but you *must* use your regular (non-prefixed) username to login from your district's login page.
* Either a "Change Password" link or a message about account management, but not both. If you get a "Your account is managed by..." note, that means you login through your district's identity provider, and you cannot change your password in Platform.
	* Note: Your account can be managed by Clever or ClassLink, but not by the birds. :)

## Changing Your Password
If your account is managed by Platform, you can change your password using the **Change Password** link. Clicking it will lead you to this page:

To change your password, just enter your current password, and type (and confirm) your new password. Easy as that! If you've forgotten your current password, you will need to [contact support](/contact) **from the email address we have on file for your account**. (If there is no email on file, then you belong to a district, and you will need to contact them)
