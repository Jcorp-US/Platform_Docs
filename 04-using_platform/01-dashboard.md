# Dashboard

The first thing you encounter when you login to Platform is the dashboard. Here all your courses, as well as some other relevant information, is displayed. We'll take each object on the dashboard in turn.<br><br>

This is the _sidebar_. If you havn't already, you will become very familiar with it. This sidebar appears on every page, no matter what (though, it appears differently on phones). It has a few key components:

**The Logo**
This shows either Platform's logo, or your districts logo (if they set one).

**Account**
This is a link to your account page, which we [cover in this documentation](#/04-using_platform/02-my_account.md).

**Courses**
A link to your dashboard (this page, which displays all your courses).

What follows is a list of all your courses, themselves. You can click any of them to go there.

**Messages**
This is a link to your inbox, where you can send and recieve messages.

**Logout**
Not shown in the image. Just a logout button.

This is the main part of the dashboard. Here, all the courses for which you are either the teacher or a student in will appear. You will notice that the course name appears larger and that, below it, appears either the teacher's name or, if you're the teacher, a series of seemingly random words. These words are your _course join code_. Students will use the course join code to add the course to their account. We use course join codes because they are easier to remember, and just as random, as a random id (for example, would you prefer NESTLE-PERMANENTLY-TAPPET-LUM or EUJR093K219J289H784H3K?).

You will also notice that there is a plus (+) in the top right corner. This button creates or joins a course, which we will discuss in a later section.

And finally, you will come across these &mdash; (pictured) _widgets_. Widgets show different pieces of information. 

 * Your name
 * The time the page loaded 
 * A random word (click it to read the definition and improve your vocabulary)
