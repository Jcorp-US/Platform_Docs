# Creating Courses

Creating a new course is super easy (for a teacher, that is). Start from your [dashboard](#/04-using_platform/01-dashboard.md) and click the plus (+) button. For a student, this would allow them to join a course, using a *Course Join Code*. For a teacher, this brings you to the Course Join Page.

There are two ways to create a course: creating a new course with a name or copying a course with a Join Code.

## With a Name
Using the top option to create a course, using a name, will create a new &mdash; completely empty &mdash; course (and assign the given name to it).

## With a Course Join Code
Using the bottom option will copy most of the contents of an already-existing course. Please note that this function will only work if the original course allows copying (this setting is available on the [course settings](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/09-course_settings.md) page).
* **Note** on copying courses: Course content will be *copied* into a new course. Links and references are copied *as-is*; that is to say, they will still point to the *old resource*, and will need to be updated. This affects links in Pages, Assignment descriptions, etc., and content in Modules.

And that's it! Enjoy you're (maybe) new course.
