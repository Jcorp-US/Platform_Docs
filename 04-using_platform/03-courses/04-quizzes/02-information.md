# Quizzes Overview Page
*The quiz overview and information page* shows teachers details about a quiz and subsequent student scores. It is divided into a series of distinct sub-sections.

The "Your Quiz" block provides exports for various information about the quiz. Student Scores can be exported as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, which can then be opened or processed in a spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel) and imported into a gradebook, or as a PDF, which can be printed and saved or forwarded. A quiz itself can be viewed as HTML (opened in browser) or saved/printed as a PDF. Finally, a quiz can be deleted by selecting that button in the top right hand corner of this block.

Immediately following is the score graph. If the quiz has been taken at least once, this graph will appear. It is a line graph and represents the percentage of students who got a given question correct (with the question number represented on the X-axis and the percentage correct on the Y-axis).
* **NOTE:** The question number used in this bar graph is the same as shown in the HTML preview and on quiz score reports but **not** the question number shown in the PDF (which is numbered differently).

If applicable, following is a list of student submissions and grades. For each, (and this behavior is *different* from the assignment page) clicking on the name will bring you to the student's information page, while clicking on the percentage grade will bring you to the [score information and quiz grader page](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/04-quizzes/03-score_info.md).

If the student's grade is followed by a blue asterisk, then that score contains a question that requires a teacher to manually grade it, which has not been done. Thus, the score is not final; click on the score (as described above) to grade the ungraded questions (most likely written response). 

If the student's name is followed by a red asterisk (and a student can have both red and blue), then the student left the quiz window or tab while taking it. While we make a note of this, we do **not** remove points or otherwise punish for it. It is up to the discretion of the teacher to determine if this constitutes cheating &mdash; and what to do about it. (**NOTE**: There are, albeit rare, false positives and false negatives; use reasonable judgement when determining if you believe a student cheated).
