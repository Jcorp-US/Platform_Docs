# Understanding This Documentation

This documentation is sort of like a manual, FAQ, and how-to guide wrapped up into one. Its main goal is to help you, and it was written by the very same developers who wrote Platform. 

What the Platform Docs **do** include:
* Help with common problems
* Step-by-step directions to do nearly anything
* Information on how features work
* Known bugs and work-arounds
* Limitations of Platform
* Plenty of images
* Some jokes and for-laughs 

What the Platform Docs **do not** include:
* A complete list of all bugs
	* See the [bug tracker](/support/bugs)
* Notes on upcoming features 
	* See [feature requests](/support/features)
* Mistakes
	* At least, not deliberately.

We encourage every user to read through (or at least familiarize yourself) with the Platform Docs before starting to use Platform, and to reference them regularly when you have questions. If you have a question, and cannot find the answer to it here, [contact us](/contact).
