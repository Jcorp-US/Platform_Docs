# Course Settings

*(This section applies to teachers, only.)*
Platform was designed to be configurable. With that in mind, enter course settings. This page offers configurable customization settings for your courses.

Here are those options, and their descriptions:

<img src="./files/teachers_course-settings.png" style="float: right; max-width: 45%; margin-right: 20px;">

 * **Top bar** The top bar provides certain options related to your course.
	 * **Delete Course** Permanently removes a course, along with all data associated with it.
	 * **Duplicate Course** Makes a fresh copy of a course; a new semester, for example.
		 * Please read "Note on copying courses" on [this](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/01-creating_courses.md) page.
	 * **Publish/Archive Course** If a course is unpublished (its initial state), publish it. This makes it active, and allows students to join. If a course if published, archive it, removing all students and taking it out of your active course navigation. (You can still access an archived course, from your dashboard).
 * **Course Name** The name of your course, displayed to both you and your students.
 * **Course Join Code** A unique identifier that your students will use to join your course. Click "Re-Generate" to get a new code.
 * **Course Display Color** Color used in course theme. Both the course navigation and dashboard card will contain this color, giving your course a distinctive look.
 * **Course Is Copyable?** Whether to allow _other_ users to copy your course. This does not apply to you duplicating your own course.
 * **Language** The language of your course's content. Platform is only available in English, so this will not affect the Platform interface. This is used by Platform to classify your course, and may help to display non-Latin text. 
 * **Course Originater** Internal value used to determine if you created this course, copied it, etc. It means very little to you.
 * **Students can Privately Message** We call this "forward selection for a future feature". That is, allowing you to decide this now, so when we add this feature (as you can tell, we haven't yet) we don't need to bother you about it. In the future, students will likely be able to [message](#/04-using_platform/04-messages/01-about_messages.md) each other, if you allow it.
 * **Course Description** Describe your course, your goals, etc. Your students will see this first, on the front page of your course above [modules](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/02-modules.md), so make it count.
