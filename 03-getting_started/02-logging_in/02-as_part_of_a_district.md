# Logging In, as Part of A District

In order to log in to Platform through your district, you will need to know your district's login page. You can often find this by going to your district's website. (It should start with [app.platformlms.org/d/...](https://app.platformlms.org/d/demo)). If you can't find it, contact your teacher (or, if you're a teacher, an administrator). If they don't know, a district IT department may be able to help. You can also contact us, but be warned: You'll get a disappointment look first.

Once you actually get to your district's page, one of three things will happen
1. You'll need to login through Platform.
	* Your district has created your account through Platform, and you'll need to ask them for your username and password (we **can't** help you).
2. You will be redirected to [Clever](https://clever.com). 
	* You will login through Clever, which may, in turn, send you to your district's identity provider (often Google or Microsoft). Ask your district or Clever for help.
3. You will be directed to [ClassLink](https://classlink.com).
	* Same as Clever (above). Ask your district or ClassLink for help.

If you know that you log in through Clever or ClassLink, you can click the respective button on [this](https://app.platformlms.org/) page.
