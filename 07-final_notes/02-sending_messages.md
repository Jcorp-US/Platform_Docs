Sending a message is really quite easy. Access the page shown above by going to the messages dashboard (click "Messages" in the sidebar) and clicking the "New" button.

Then, select the "To" field. A popup will appear, allowing you to select a person to send the message to.  After that, input a subject and actually type your message (the message supports rich and formatted text).

Click "Submit" and you're done! The message will nearly immediately be send to the receiver's message box. After they read it, they can reply or forward it.  You cannot delete a message once it has been sent (though the receiver can delete it).

### Who can I send a message to?
* Students
	* Any of your teachers.
* Teachers
	* Any of your students.
* Everyone
	* Yourself (yes, you can message yourself, but why would you?).

That's it! Enjoy messages.
