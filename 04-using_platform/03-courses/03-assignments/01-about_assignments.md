# About Assignments

Assignments are awesome. Assignments can be anything you want your students to do. And students can return nearly anything for grading (though, [submissions](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/03-assignments/02-submissions.md) are covered in a  [different section](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/03-assignments/02-submissions.md).).

First, lets create a assignment: 
### How to create an Assignment
1. [Go-to](#/04-using_platform/01-dashboard.md) or [create](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/01-creating_courses.md) the course that the assignment belongs to.

2. Then, look to the top portion of the screen. You should see the *course header* (it shows the course name and a list of pages).

3. Click on **Assignments**.

4. Click **add**.

5. Enter a unique name for this new assignment.

6. Click **Create Assignment!**.

***

Now, let's discuss the **assignment page**.
### Assignment Pages

On the top left you will see the assignment name. Like a lot of underlined text on Platform, this name is editable (underlined text is either editable or a link). Feel free to change it. On the right side, there is a *delete* button. 

Then, you will see a rich text editor. Type the assignment's directions here (describe what the student should do, elaborate on classwork, etc.). The rich text editor will accept __*formatted*__ text; links to webpages, course files, quizzes, and other assignments; and images (either online images, or uploaded ones).

Following, there are some assignment settings:

1. **Submission Type**: Depending on your selection here, your students can submit a link, plain text, or an uploaded file. Once this is set for the first time, it cannot be changed.

    * If your students submit a file, we will try to display it. We can currently display .docx (but NOT .doc), .pdf, and .mp4. 
    
2. **Due Date** In month/day/year format, this is the date for which all submissions must be submitted before. Submissions submitted *after* this day will be marked late. This day is considered begun at 12:00AM (midnight) EST.

Finally, there is a bar graph of grades (letter; A, B, C, etc) and a list of student submissions (with grades shown on right-hand side) select any students name to view and grade [their submission](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/03-assignments/02-submissions.md). Late submissions are marked as such.
