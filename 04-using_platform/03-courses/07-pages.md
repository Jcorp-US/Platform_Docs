# Pages

Pages are easy; really easy. They're exactly what they sound like; so let's get started...

A page has two parts: a title and content.

### Title
The title of the page is shown in listings, and as a header to the page. To edit the title, just (from the page editor) click on it and start typing.

### Content
A page's content is created using the familiar [Passage](#/07-final_notes/02-acknowledgements.md) editor. A page, which can be styled as you which, can contain bold, italic, underlined, or striked-out text; links, breaks, and images; and embedded content (like files from Platform, YouTube videos, Google Drive content, etc.).
 * *To embed content, get an embed code from the site you want to embed (it usually looks like "&lt;iframe src=...") or click "embed a file on Platform."*

To save changes to a Page (title or content) click the "Save" button in the top right. To prevent [students](#/04-using_platform/03-courses/08-students.md) from being able to see the page, click "Hide" (you can unhide it at any time). Click "Delete" to remove a page (note: this is *permanent* and irreveversible).
