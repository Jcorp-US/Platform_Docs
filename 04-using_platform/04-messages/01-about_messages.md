# Messages

Messages are the communication center of Platform. Use messages to connect to other users, and share information. You can access, send, and reply to messages on the *message dashboard*, and you will be automatically notified when you recieve a message while using Platform. The message dashboard (shown below) shows a list of received messages on the left of the page, and the message, itself, on the right.

## Messages
Every message contains four distinct parts:
 * A sender, the person who sent the message.
 * A sendee (or receiver), the person to whom the message is directed to. 
 * A subject, which briefly (!) describes the contents of the message.
 * The message, itself.

Messages facilitate communication between teachers and students. In the future, they may also allow communication between students.  They remain an ever important tool for user connection and collaboration. Ready to [send a message](#/04-using_platform/04-messages/02-sending_messages.md)?
