# Students
**Note:** The *students* tab is not visible to students, so this section of the documentation is only for teachers.

It is important to know who is in your course. It's also important to be able to access the users in your course. Luckily, there exists a feature to satisfy both of these goals.

The *students* page offers teachers a convenient list of students who are currently enrolled in their course. By clicking on a student, a teacher can see more information about them and, if needed, send a message. You will also notice that there are links to help new students join the course. One link offers the option of displaying the Course Join Code; for example, projected onto a whiteboard. The other allows teachers to print and handout directions to their students.
