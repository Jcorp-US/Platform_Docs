# Modules

Modules serve as the homepage of every course, and for good reason: they serve to bring everything together. Think of modules sort of like folders: they store... well, anything. Modules can contain any combination assignments, quizzes, files, and pages.

## Creating a Module
To create a new module (teachers only), click the "Add" link (at the top of the page, next to the "Modules" header). Type in a name for this module (which you will not be able to change later), and you're done!

## Adding Content to Modules
Initially, all modules are empty. You will want, doubtlessly, to add content. To do so, click the (+) button (which should be on the right side of the page, across from the module name). You will be asked what type of content you would like to add. Once you select a content type, you will be given a list of content, of the selected type, in your course (for example, if you selected "Assignment," you will be given a list of assignments in your course). Select the object to add, and you've succeeded!

### Other Module Options
You will notice that there are two other buttons on the top left of the module, next to the add button. One, the hide button (looks like an eye, maybe with a slash through it), will hide that module, so only you (and not your students) can see it. Click that button again (now there will not be a slash) to unhide the module. The last button, a trash can, will delete the module. Be careful, because *this action is permanent*.

## Module Content
Each object in a module serves as a link to the specified object. 
    * **Note**: That reference will persist even if you rename or delete the object it points to; for example: if you delete an assignment, that assignment will *not* be deleted from any module it may have been in, but the link the module contains will no longer work. Module references are also unaffected if you rename the content it links to, though the link will still work.

### Removing Content
To delete content from a module, just click the "X" button on the right-hand side of the module link.
### Reodering Content
Content can be reordered, within a module, by drag-and-dropping the content link. Using a computer mouse (this is not likely to work on a phone), hover over the content link and press down on your mouse button. Without releasing the button, drag the content to its new position. **NOTE**: Content cannot be moved from one module to another, just reordered within one module.

Modules are great. They serve as the holding area of your course. While other pages may have more sophistication and more options, everything comes together in the collections we call "modules."
