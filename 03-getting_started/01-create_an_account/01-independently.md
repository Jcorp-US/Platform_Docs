# Creating an Independent Account

To get started, go to the [Platform login page](/start) ([for Students](/signup?t=s); [for Teachers](/signup?t=t)).

## Creating your Account
You'll need to input the following information:
* **Your Full Name** Typed separately, as first name and last name.
* **Email Address** Must be a real and current email (we will confirm). Students can use their parent's email.
* **Username** You'll use this to login. It must be unique from any other independent user's email.
* **Password** You type this twice, to confirm it. Don't forget it.
	* If you have a **secure** password manager ([Firefox Lockwise](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/) is a good one), feel free to use it. 
	* Please use a secure password. We make no attempt to determine if your password is secure (it's meaningless; *Password1!* meets many definitions of a secure password, but will be easily guessed), but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick a good, strong password. If you need help, both [Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/create-secure-passwords-keep-your-identity-safe) and [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/strong-passwords-9-rules-to-help-you-make-and-remember-your-login-credentials/) have good guides on creating strong passwords.
* You must agree to Platform's [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## Verifying your Account
Once your account is created, we'll send you a verification code. The verification code is a 5-digit code, used to confirm your email account. Only after you type the code in will your account be activated. So go ahead and check your email (be sure to look in spam, if you don't see it) and either type in the code (on the same page you were on) or click the confirmation link in the email.
* If the email ended up in spam, make sure to add [platformlms@mail.jcorp-us.com](mailto:platformlms@mail.jcorp-us.com) to your address book. We may send you important account notifications in the future (along with a welcome email and some other updates). This is an automated email address, so please do not send any messages to it. If you need to [contact us](/contact), click that link or email [hello@platformlms.org](mailto:hello@platformlms.org).

## Account Confirmation
That's it! You're done. Now, [log in here](https://app.platformlms.org). Bookmark that link, if you want. You can also save that page to your home screen (if you're on mobile). Oh, and by the way, **welcome to Platform**! :)
